Beepforce United
=========
:sound: *Let's put that old PC speaker on your motherboard to use!* :notes:

This is a project I worked on in my spare time at school back in 2010. The python script can play self-composed or transcribed songs on the tiny internal speaker/buzzer/beeper or whatever you want to call it which may or may not be present on your motherboard. (They are quite rare these days but if there is none the OS sometimes makes up for it by generating the sound via the sound card... Of course the real deal is way better :smile:)

Requirements:
- **Python 3** installed
- any **Windows** OS (I used the `winsound` module which provides `Beep(frequency, duration)` but feel free to contribute an alternative - I would be more than happy to see a platform-independent solution)

Features:
- 3 demo songs included!
- songs with multiple tracks
- frequency visualisation
- exporting tracks as standalone python script
- **orchestration: client&server for parallel playback** (hence: Beepforce *United* :wink:)
- sorry, no english translation

## First steps
*TODO: short usage guide*
